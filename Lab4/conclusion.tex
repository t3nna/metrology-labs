\subsection{Output voltage of a voltage source}

 This experiment has shown the importance of a systematic error. When the meter's internal resistance was significantly higher than the circuit's, the device was functioning properly and the systematic error had very small values. But, as the circuit resistance increased, so did the error. When the circuit's resistance exceeded the meter's, it became clear that measurement results without the systematic error included would be of no value.

\subsection{Voltage divider}

This time a more complex circuit was used, which brought attention to the systematic error's influence on other circuit components. When the output voltage was measured with a meter with an internal resistance significantly lower than the divider's, the amount of current flowing through the meter caused the divider to lose its original function.
