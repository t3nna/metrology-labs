\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Theory}

Electric current can be measured in two ways: directly or indirectly. To make a direct measurement, the meter must be connected to the circuit in series. An ideal meter should have a zero internal resistance as not to impact the current flowing through; in reality, meters will always have a non-zero resistance creating a voltage drop.

The systematic error of current measurements $\Delta_m I$ can be calculated using formulas shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:DeltamI},~\ref{eq:deltamI} (for: $I_A$ -- measured current, $R_A$ -- internal ammeter resistance, $R_C$ -- circuit resistance). 

\begin{equation}
	\Delta_m I = -I_A \cdot\frac{R_A}{R_C}	
	\label{eq:DeltamI}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\delta_m I = -\frac{R_A}{R_A + R_C}
	\label{eq:deltamI}
\end{equation}
