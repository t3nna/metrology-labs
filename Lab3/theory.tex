\section{Introduction}

In the last laboratory we were learning about DC voltage measurement with an analogue and digital multimeter. We explored their parameters and calculated measurement errors and found out their sources. 


\subsection*{First Experiment}

In the first experiment we connected voltmeter parallel to the circuit which consists of power source and resistor. From the lecture we know that proper way to measure voltage is to connect voltmeter with infinite internal resistance, so current does not flow through, but in real world meter is not ideal and it's changes the measured value. During this experiment we observe the influence of internal voltmeter resistance on the accuracy of measurement.
\subsection*{Second Experiment}

In the second experiment we are using two voltmeters power supply and voltage divider. We learned how how voltage dividers work and how load on output changes output voltage. We will consider 4 different configurations: 2 with internal resistance of 1 k Ohm and two with 1 M Ohm using different k coefficients.
